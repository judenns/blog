            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Paulina! Ever since I can remember, I've had a passion for
              creativity and problem-solving. That's what led me to the world of
              front-end web development. There's something magical about seeing
              an idea come to life in the browser—whether it's a simple layout
              experiment or a complex interface for a bigger project.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I love getting lost in a good book. My taste
              is pretty eclectic: I'll happily read everything from fantasy
              novels to biographies of tech pioneers. Reading helps me unwind
              and often sparks new ideas for my coding projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big passion of mine is the great outdoors. Hiking allows
              me to disconnect from the digital world and reconnect with nature.
              I love challenging hikes with rewarding views at the top. And if
              I'm not on the trails, you might catch me rock climbing. The
              combination of mental focus and physical endurance is a perfect
              parallel to tackling tough coding challenges!
            </p>
            <h2>Some of my favorite books:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas (for
                helpful insights into software development)
              </li>
              <li>
                "Ready Player One" by Ernest Cline (for some futuristic
                escapism)
              </li>
              <li>"The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien (for a bit of fantasy fun)</li>
              <li>"Educated" by Tara Westover (for incredible inspiration)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I absolutely love my workspace as a place that inspires me to do
              my best work, so I thought I'd share it with you. I hope this blog
              not only documents my growth but also helps others see that coding
              can be for everyone. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
